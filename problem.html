      To think that we are responsible for over 90% of the carbon emissions placed in the Earth’s atmosphere. There are various factors to climate change and the effect that it has on the environment. Carbon Dioxide can be emitted through pollution that we cause, through vehicles that we use, and through factories that we work in. There is no way to stop the emissions of Carbon Dioxide, but there are ways to limit the amount that is being produced. We can do this through using more renewable energy so we aren’t overusing supplies that grow over millions of years. We can use more natural types of energy like biomass energy, tidal energy, solar energy, wind energy, etc. We can also limit the amount of deforestation by using other materials besides wood. There are plenty of alternatives to use. We can start going more green and stop driving cars and other vehicles to locations that aren’t far. Factories can even limit how much they produce in factories and food establishments. When factories produce certain items, it often requires killing animals, tearing down trees, using crops to get a specific color pigment. The after effects of factories are even worse as it leads to mass pollution. We can limit pollution by recycling but, did you know that only 1% of materials put to get recycled actually get recycled? Yes, only 1% of the billions of items are getting recycled. The other 99% get thrown into another countries land which just leads to more pollution and entropy which is the spreading of Carbon Dioxide. There are also natural factors of Carbon Dioxide emissions. Examples would be the Earth’s axis, the Earth’s tilt, and the Earth’s rotation around the sun. Radiation from the sun also enters the Earth’s atmosphere.
